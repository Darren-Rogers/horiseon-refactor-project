Search engine optimazation allows your webpage to be visible to more viewers accesing. Online reputation management allows owners to control what users see when searching for a webpage. Social media marketing allows owners to expand markets and adverdisment through the use of social media platforms. Search Optimaztion allows businesses to reduce the cost of advertisment through searches via the internet.

#### Refactoring
I changed semantic elements which gives a logistal flow to the code, I add alt attibutes to images, I grouped together repetitive css styling elements, and I gave the webpage a clear title.
